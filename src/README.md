## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

Data is stored in a local SQLite file (`src/activities.db`) and is preserved across restarts.
